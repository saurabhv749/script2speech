Once upon a time, in a bustling forest, lived a tiny ant named Annie.

She was smaller than all the other ants in her colony, but her heart was full of big dreams.

One sunny morning, Annie overheard the elder ants talking about a magical sugar crystal

hidden deep in the meadow, sparkling brighter than the stars.

"Whoever finds it," they said, "will bring sweetness to the whole colony!"

Annie decided she would find that crystal.

She packed a tiny leaf bag and set off

even though the other ants giggled, saying, "You're too small, Annie! The meadow is too big"
